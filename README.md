This project was developed during the Give(a)Go event and focuses on building a Multi-Agent System powered by an AI chatbot API. The system demonstrates how multiple intelligent agents can collaborate, communicate, and solve tasks efficiently by leveraging conversational AI capabilities.

The core idea is to simulate real-world problem-solving by distributing responsibilities across multiple AI agents, each designed with a specific role.
